== ABODE related ==
  
  * June 2nd 2010 i noticed a problem for the function GridExtent.enlargeOneCell() in 
    Sextante 0.3.0  & 0.55 which causes XMax of the GridExtend not to be enlarged (on the 
    computer of ChenLu and my machine when using the sextante main lib).
    However, it does actually work for other datasets.
    
  * implement x% values for MCP (see Harris et al 1990 on methods to do that)
    => almost done; implemented fixed mean and median, but not yet floating mean and median
  
  * function for overlap and similarity analysis of HR shapes
  
  * add a scaling *checkbox*, so that output of different kernels can be compared
    (e.g. KD value at a single point, i.e. with no others in the surrounding, should 
    be one or generate probability surface? 
    ...mhm not sure if the latter requires to consider the whole dataset?)
    and: contours based on the volume should be the same - independent of 
    amplitude scaling

  * there seems to be a problem with calculating the max value for the
  	topographic contour lines (though I used a sextante function here)   
  
  * implement scaling of input data (standardization)

  * implement discretization (push points, see Abode Manual)

  * check if Sextante KD evaluates point distance h first 
    (and distance to center of pixel: probably not) : AB Manual p.14 

  * check how Donut situations are treated in Sextante
    (e.g. island in a lake) : AB Manual p.5

  * calculate probability for other topographic contour values (or 
    just create other contours?)
    
  * handle points with distance = 0? (see Seaman et al.
    1998 p. 97 and ABode manual), (or dist < 0.5*cellsize ?)
    
  * allow multiple animals per file
  
  => for more infos on possible options sea Seaman et al. 1998 on KERNELHR
  
=== user friendliness ===

  * write ASCII grid files
  
  * enable carto projection from WGS84 (Lat/Lon) to UTM for GPS points
  
  * output of metadata?
  
  * 3D plot of KD
  
  * adapter to import Sextante raster format (as RasterImage)
