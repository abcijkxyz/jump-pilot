2018-1-20 Giuseppe Aruta. Corrected a list of bug and implementations to speed
    up OpenKLEM;
    1) Reduced hydro table to 2500 cells for OpenKLEM output tab (speedup time)
    2) added monitoring to mostly all processes
    3) workaround to avoid 'gost' list of raster layers (not yet solved)
    4) workaround to solve border false values on the borders for aspect and 
       slope rasters
    5) added file type to exported raster plugin

2018-1-7 Giuseppe Aruta. OpenKLEM output tab. Reduced from 5000 to 2500 cells
    output hydro table

2018-12-20 Giuseppe Aruta. RasterHistogramPlugIn. Changed rightButton() action to 
    OpenJUMP AbstractPlugIn action in order to interupt the process if it takes 
    too much time

2018-10-04 Giuseppe Aruta. Moved SlopeAspectHillShadePlugin to Geomorphometry
    tree node

2018-10-04 Giuseppe Aruta. PluginUtils class - Kinematic Local Excess Model.
  *Export to csv: use "," instead of tab for data separation to facilitate 
   Excell import (as sugested by users)

2018-07-26 Giuseppe Aruta. PluginUtils class - Kinematic Local Excess Model.
   * loading project checkbox: added option to load project raster files 
     into OpenJUMP view when loading project file
   * Added ChangeLog file.
     
2018-07-12 Giuseppe Aruta. Kinematic Local Excess Model.
  * Option: "Basin area km2", substituted scientific notation (2E-3) with 
    numeric one (0.002)
  * Sub-basin warning now shows also the range of area within the algorithm can 
    be applied
  * Substituted [m s.m.m.] with:  [m s.l.m]-Italian (metri sul livello marino)
     and [m a.s.l.]-English (metre above sea level)
     
2018-06-18 Giuseppe Aruta.
  * General. Changed icons to famfamfam or OJ ones. Added gpl_2 file
  * General. Optimized icon view on Windows.
  * Kinematic Local Excess Model - Output. Added option to export tables to 
    .csv file
  * Kinematic Local Excess Model - Output. 
    Option "Export to .ods" (to libreoffice) activated only if OpenDoc libs
    are located into OJ/LIB/EXT
