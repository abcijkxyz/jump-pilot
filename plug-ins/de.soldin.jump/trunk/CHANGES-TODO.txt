(done) rxtx iterate over subfolders and use the 
	first word of the os name for checking e.g. mac,windows,linux
(done) rename "set task" to "select project to track"
	"add point" to "Add coordinate to layer or feature"
	"insert points" to "Insert coordinate to closest segment"
(done) reinstate cts projection support
(done) fix error message: "Found no serial ports. "

gps rc3
(fix) classloader issue leading to reprojection class cast error

gps rc4
(fix) rxtx native lib loader ignoring one word os's e.g."Linux"
(fix) solved setYx issue in gps reprojection leading to wrong results

final
- add hint in gps options to install cts if cts missing
- catch CannotCreateTransformException and show user (remove towgs84 for testing)
- let classloader add ignore .* files
- lost fix doesn't work anymore, check that
- document -Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyUSB0 java rxtx switch

renew list ports everytime optionspanel is opened

allow to manually add port(mask)s

let crosshair follow gps coordinate
or disable crosshair if tracking disabled

separate track now to "gps on" and "track project" (combines track on & select task)

rxtx/*/ aufräumen nur dlls

(arnd) manual input field for tracking frequency e.g.(0.2)s

(arnd) averageing gps over configurable timeframe

(arnd) auto add points after interval (or distance?)

gui support for gpsd and file input


DRAFTS email to merge

rc2
- (done) rxtx iterate over subfolders and use the name for os checking e.g. mac,windows,linux
-rename "set task" to "attach to active project"
 "add point" to "create point"
 "insert points" to "append point to geometry"
- (done) reinstate cts projection support
-fix error message:
Found no serial ports. Most likely you don't have Java Communication API (correctly) installed. GPSExtension will be disabled for now.


TODO (priority sorted)

- cleanup rxtx/*/ folder
- add and explain mac rxtx scripts
- move crosshair on every gps update (jukka)
- let crosshair follow gps coordinate or disable crosshair if tracking disabled
- separate "track now" to "gps on" and "track project" (combines track on & select task), this way the viewport can be recentered on different intervals than the gps updates itself (jukka)
- manual input field for tracking frequency e.g.(0.2)s (arnd)

- renew ports list everytime optionspanel is opened, better add a scan button to circumvent delay on scan
- gui support for gpsd and file input


- averageing gps over configurable timeframe (arnd)
- auto add points after interval (or distance?) (arnd) 
- allow to manually add serial port(mask)s



--- GEOMCONV ---

geomconv 0.3 changes

- language files in lib/ext/geomconv until integration in oj core
- converts selected geoms or selected layers
- confirmation dialog in layer mode
- available in main menu 'tools->edit geometry->convert geometries/layers' or layer view panel context menu 'convert geometries/layers'
- tools to explicitly 'remove closing line segments' and 'close open linestrings'
- support for multigeometries now
- polygons to multi* keeps line segments (thanks michael)
- geometries to (multi)polygon detects and adds holes now (shamelessly grabbed from shapefiles code) (tip by larry)
- i18n support (please edit lib/ext/geomconv/gc.properties and save as gc_<langid>.properties and send it for inclusion)
- translations from peppe, michael
